# 👷‍♀️ TypeScript Hardhat configuration template 👷‍♂️

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
